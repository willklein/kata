README for puzzles
This repo includes my solutions to various programming challenges. Currently there is one problem/solution.

routespuzzle: On a nineteen by nineteen grid, with the points (13, 4) and (8, 7) blocked, how many routes are there from
the northwest corner to the southeast one, traveling only east and south between points?
