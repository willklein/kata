# gameoflife

I had a set of coding exercises to choose from. I went with Conway's game of life because it interested me the most.

I took a roughly two hours to get it working, and about another hour adding a canvas UI to demonstrate the implementation.
There are two input sets included but additional sets could easily be added later.
